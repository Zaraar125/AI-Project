# Multi-Modal Meme Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify memes into three categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The classification is based on both the textual content and the image features of the memes. We leverage a custom neural network architecture that processes text and image data separately before combining them into a single layer within the network for classification.
